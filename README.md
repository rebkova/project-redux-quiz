A quiz about Technigo teachers built with Redux. :thinking: :grey_question:

## :brain: Learning objectives
- what is global state
- what is redux
- how to use selectors to access redux state
- how to use dispatch to trigger redux actions

## :heavy_check_mark: Features
- showing one question/page, implemented Next question button after the question has been answered
- when the user selects an answer, they receive a notice if they were correct or not
- keeping track of which question the user is currently on and how many are left
- after answering all the questions, a summary screen is displayed telling how many questions were answered correctly
- incorporated Lottie animations for every question and in the case of wrong/correctly answered question

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Future improvements
- highlighting the correct answer if the incorrect was chosen
- giving score for each correct answer and deduct them for every false one
- a countdown timer for answering the question -> marking answer as wrong when the time is up & question not yet answered
